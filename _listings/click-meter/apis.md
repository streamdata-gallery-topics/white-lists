description: ClickMeter was founded in 2012 as a byproduct of an experienced web-marketing
  agency. The ClickMeter System was initially a web tool created to address the needs
  of our agency to precisely count and track the web-marketing actions we performed
  for our customers.The system evolved rapidly, and emerged as one of the most widely
  used software solutions in our agency to collect, analyze, and share data for and
  with our customers. After few years after the development of the first ClickMeter
  system, we decided to go live with a service that can be useful to everyone involved
  in web-marketing activities.

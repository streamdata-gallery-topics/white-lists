        **This endpoint allows you to remove one or more IPs from your IP whitelist.**

        You can remove one IP at a time, or you can remove multiple IP addresses.

        IP Access Management allows you to control which IP addresses can be used to access your account, either through the User Interface or the API. There is no limit to the number of IP addresses that you can add to your whitelist. It is possible to remove your own IP address from the whitelist, thus preventing yourself from accessing your account.

        For more information, please see our [User Guide](http://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/ip_access_management.html).

        **This endpoint allows you to retrieve your current email address whitelist settings.**

        The address whitelist setting whitelists a specified email address or domain for which mail should never be suppressed. For example, you own the domain ???example.com,??? and one or more of your recipients use email@example.com addresses, by placing example.com in the address whitelist setting, all bounces, blocks, and unsubscribes logged for that domain will be ignored and sent as if under normal sending conditions.

        Mail settings allow you to tell SendGrid specific things to do to every email that you send to your recipients over SendGrid???s [Web API](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/Web_API/mail.html) or [SMTP Relay](https://sendgrid.com/docs/API_Reference/SMTP_API/index.html).

  title: SendGrid Delete Access Settings Whitelist
  description: |-
    **This endpoint allows you to remove one or more IPs from your IP whitelist.**

    You can remove one IP at a time, or you can remove multiple IP addresses.

    IP Access Management allows you to control which IP addresses can be used to access your account, either through the User Interface or the API. There is no limit to the number of IP addresses that you can add to your whitelist. It is possible to remove your own IP address from the whitelist, thus preventing yourself from accessing your account.

    For more information, please see our [User Guide](http://sendgrid.com/docs/User_Guide/Settings/ip_access_management.html).
